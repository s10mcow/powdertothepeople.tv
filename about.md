At the moment there isn't a whole lot going on here as powdertothepeople.tv has morphed from my previous project PTTP which was very much not a place to read about JS and Beer,
instead a place to see snowboarding porn. 

The old site is still available [here](http://www.powdertothepeople.tv/pttp/index.html), it was my very first site I ever built and still possesses nostalgia for me.
 
Anyways I will be writing about things I learn, and feel the need to share, on my new journey as a JS developer focused on Angular (at the moment), and also if I feel 
the need to share anything about beer. I do live in the micro-brew capital of Europe - The Netherlands - so it would be a shame to not mention any beers along the way. 
Oh there are so many - I wouldn't know where to start or stop...until I do know - long live JS and long live delicious craft beer.
